# puppet_standalone
A simple Linux container for puppet training

This is just a Ubuntu or CentOS 7 with puppet tools for puppet training.

It comes with a preinstalled puppet agent, r10k, generate-puppetfile, and emacs and the repository of this book

https://www.packtpub.com/eu/networking-and-servers/puppet-5-beginners-guide-third-edition

and starts an sshd for easy login.

To start do something like this:

docker run -d --rm --name puppet --hostname puppet -e PASSWD=yourpasswd -p 1234:22 harenber/puppet_standalone

(for Ubuntu) or

docker run -d --rm --privileged -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup --name puppet --hostname puppet -e PASSWD=yourpasswd -p 1234:22 harenber/puppet_standalone:CentOS7

(for CentOS7, as CentOS7 is based on systemd, you need to run privileged and mount cgroups)

which will set "yourpasswd" as password and opens the sshd on port 1234.

DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU ARE OPENING AN SSHD TO A ROOT SHELL
